# Regression Analysis to study the Effects of Major Economical Variables on the Change in Indian GDP
Gross domestic product (GDP) is a monetary measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a specific time period.The elements considered in the Gross Domestic Product calculation can be affected by several sectors of the Indian economy. The production and the corresponding prices of product can directly influence the GDP. Not only that the components present in the Money and banking sector and also that of the financial markets can have an impact upon the Indian Gross Domestic Product. The sectors of public finance and the factor of trading and balance of payment should also be considered by discussing the factors that influence the gross domestic product. In this particular study we tried to select a sufficient number of variables from all possible sectors so that the reason behind the change in Gross Domestic Product can be accounted for. Among all the selected variables some factors can have severe impact while some can have in direct impact upon the GDP. In this study our objective is to detect those variables that are important in the concept of GDP of India and to use an appropriate regression model to express the GDP in terms of those variables.
